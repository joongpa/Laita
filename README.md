Thank you for checking out Laita! Laita helps the user track the time they spend stuyding a language. Language-learning is all about consistency, and this app makes sure the user maintains it. 

Working on this allowed me to gain a firm understanding of declarative programming in Dart as well as asynchronous programming. This app uses Flutter for the front-end and Firebase for the back-end. 

This project is no longer active.
